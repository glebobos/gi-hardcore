Verse 1: Dar was old Mister Johnson, he had troubles ob his own;
He had an ole yaller cat that wouldn't leave its home.
He tried eb'ry thing he knew to keep de cat away;
Eben sent it to de preacher, and he tole it for to stay.

Chorus: But de cat came back, couldn't stay no longer,
Yes de cat came back de very next day;
De cat came back - thought she were a goner,
But de cat came back for it wouldn't stay away.

Verse 2: De cat did hab some company one night out in de yard,
Some one frowed a boot-jack, an' dey frowed it might hard,
Caught de cat behind de ear, she thought it rather slight,
When along dar comes a brick-bat an' it knocked it out ob sight.

Chorus: But de cat came back, couldn't stay no longer,
Yes de cat came back de very next day;
De cat came back - thought she were a goner,
But de cat came back for it wouldn't stay away.
